# Introduction and Motivation

Charity is an act of kindness, where a person who has financially more than enough of what he or she needs contributes a part of his or her surplus income for the fulfilment of the needs of those who are less capable. The majority of NGOs has experienced difficulties in getting funds or other required things. Getting donor is a very hard task, and sometime dealing with some donorâ€™s conditions can be a big challenge for NGOs to fulfill.<br>

This charity management system will help NGOs to find donors easily. This system has three modules namely, Admin, NGO and Donor. Admin can login using credentials and manage the request raised by NGO by approving or rejecting it. Approval will be done after verifying the NGO documents uploaded by NGO.<br>

Admin will get the report of NGOs who get donations. NGOs can register and raise request by uploading NGO documents. Once admin gets the approval, they can login using credentials. NGO can raise request in need to the various registered donor. They can view the previous events list and donation report.<br>

Donor can simply register and login using credentials. They will get the notification of the request raised by NGOs for donation. They need to fill the details regarding donation on approval of request. Donor will get the date of donation. They can also view Donation history.
